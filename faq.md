## Has Percy Hynes White been removed from the cast?

**Unclear**.

There has been no reputable reporting on whether Percy Hynes White is still on the cast of Wednesday. All stories claiming he has been removed from the cast originate from questionable sources[^1]. Netflix has released no official statements on the matter.

## Will Principal Weems return?

**Unclear**.

In an interview with *Digital Spy*, Gwendoline Christie alluded that Weems may return:

> "We haven't seen her put in the ground, have we?" Christie said in an exclusive interview with Digital Spy. "I feel like Larissa Weems would not really be prepared to entertain or be dominated by anything as commonplace as death."

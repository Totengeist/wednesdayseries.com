![Nancy Reagan High School as shown in Wednesday](img/tour/image15.png)![A Google Maps street view of the building at Politehnica University of Bucharest used for filming](img/tour/image11.png)

The very first scene of the show shows us Wednesday&rsquo;s high school, likely located somewhere in the state of New Jersey. The exterior is a building at the Politehnica University of Bucharest.

The license plate on the Addams family&rsquo;s car is registered in the state of New Jersey. Westfield, New Jersey was the hometown of Charles Addams and an inspiration for the original Addams Family comics. The Addamses also lived in the outskirts of New Jersey in the 2019 animated film.
